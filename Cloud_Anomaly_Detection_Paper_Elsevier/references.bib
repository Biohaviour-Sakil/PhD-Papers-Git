abstract="Cloud computing affords lot of resources and computing facilities through Internet. Cloud systems attract many users with its desirable features. In spite of them, Cloud systems may experience severe security issues. Thus, it is essential to create an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to detect both insider and outsider attacks with high detection accuracy in cloud environment. This work proposes an anomaly detection system at the hypervisor layer named Hypervisor Detector that uses a hybrid algorithm which is a mixture of Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm and Artificial Neural Network (FCM-ANN) to improve the accuracy of the detection system. The proposed system is implemented and compared with Na{\"i}ve Bayes classifier and Classic ANN algorithm. The DARPA's KDD cup dataset 1999 is used for experiments. Based on extensive theoretical and performance analysis, it is evident that the proposed system is able to detect the anomalies with high detection accuracy and low false alarm rate even for low frequent attacks thereby outperforming Na{\"i}ve Bayes classifier and Classic ANN.",

Since cloud computing is a virtual pool of resources provided in an open environment (Internet), identifying intrusion of unauthorized users is one of the greatest challenges of the cloud service providers and cloud users. The artificial intelligence technique has been proposed in this paper in order to identify the intrusion of unauthorized user in a cloud environment. Application or research on cloud computing is always primarily focused upon any one of the issues. In our paper, the proposed algorithm satisfies the security aspects of cloud computing and the performance testing of the implementation satisfies the performance issues of cloud computing.",

abstract="Cloud data centres are implemented as large-scale clusters with demanding requirements for service performance, availability and cost of operation. As a result of scale and complexity, data centres typically exhibit large numbers of system anomalies resulting from operator error, resource over/under provisioning, hardware or software failures and security issus anomalies are inherently difficult to identify and resolve promptly via human inspection. Therefore, it is vital in a cloud system to have automatic system monitoring that detects potential anomalies and identifies their source. In this paper we present a lightweight anomaly detection tool for Cloud data centres which combines extended log analysis and rigorous correlation of system metrics, implemented by an efficient correlation algorithm which does not require training or complex infrastructure set up. The LADT algorithm is based on the premise that there is a strong correlation between node level and VM level metrics in a cloud system. This correlation will drop significantly in the event of any performance anomaly at the node-level and a continuous drop in the correlation can indicate the presence of a true anomaly in the node. The log analysis of LADT assists in determining whether the correlation drop could be caused by naturally occurring cloud management activity such as VM migration, creation, suspension, termination or resizing. In this way, any potential anomaly alerts are reasoned about to prevent false positives that could be caused by the cloud operator's activity. We demonstrate LADT with log analysis in a Cloud environment to show how the log analysis is combined with the correlation of systems metrics to achieve accurate anomaly detection.",

abstract="Now a days, many enterprise applications are using cloud platform. Security is the most sensitive issue in cloud platform. Intrusion detection System is used to protect the Virtual machine from threats. This paper proposes Application level Signature based Semantic Intrusion Detection System, which concentrates on the application level to detect application specific attacks. A packet sniffer is placed between cloud user and Virtual cloud provider. The packets of various protocols are captured by packet sniffer and dispatch it to its corresponding parser. The parser translates a sequence of packets into protocol messages and dispatches the packet to the corresponding state machine which consists of message parsing grammar. The message parsing grammar analyses the messages and checks with the semantic rules. If any signature does not matches with the rule-base and found to be malicious. The IDS interpreter generates alert to the cloud provider. The Signature based semantic Intrusion Detection System reduces the false alarm rate. So, the accuracy of the detection rate gets increased.",

abstract = {Cloud research to date has lacked data on the characteristics of the production virtual machine (VM) workloads of large cloud providers. A thorough understanding of these characteristics can inform the providers’ resource management systems, e.g. VM scheduler, power manager, server health manager. In this paper, we fi rst introduce an extensive characterization of Microsoft Azure’s VM workload, including distributions of the VMs’ lifetime, deployment size, and resource consumption. We then show that certain VM behaviors are fairly consistent over multiple lifetimes, i.e. history is an accurate predictor of future behavior. Based on this observation, we next introduce Resource Central (RC), a system that collects VM telemetry, learns these behaviors offline, and provides predictions online to various resource managers via a general client-side library. As an example of RC’s online use, we modify Azure’s VM scheduler to leverage predictions in oversubscribing servers (with oversubscribable VM types), while retaining high VM performance. Using real VM traces, we then show that the prediction-informed schedules increase utilization and prevent physical resource exhaustion. We conclude that providers can exploit their workloads’ characteristics and machine learning to improve resource management substantially.},
